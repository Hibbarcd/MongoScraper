Using Mongoose, MongoDB, and Cheerio to scrape a website for data


## Instructions

* Open `server.js` and navigate to LocalHost 3000

use the link /scrape to cause the program to scrape the trending articles from the site to the web page

use the link /articles to view all scraped in the database in JSON format

use /articles/:id to search for selected articles by their id, as can be found in the DB or in the console window

use /articles/:id

When clearing a note, hit delete, and it will clear, but remember to hit save to keep it in that empty state.
